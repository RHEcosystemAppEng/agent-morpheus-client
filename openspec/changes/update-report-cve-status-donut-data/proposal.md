# Change: Use product summary cveStatusCounts for report CVE status donut

## Why
The report page currently derives CVE status counts from the per-CVE justification list, which drifts from the backend summary and risks mismatched totals. The backend now exposes `product.summary.cveStatusCounts` to provide authoritative, aggregated status counts for the selected report context.

## What Changes
- Source the CVE status donut chart data from `product.summary.cveStatusCounts` instead of computing counts from `summary.cves`
- Define how status keys map to chart slices (vulnerable / not_vulnerable / uncertain) and how to handle missing or empty maps
- Keep loading and empty-state behavior aligned with the new data source

## Impact
- Affected specs: report-page
- Affected code: report page CVE status donut chart, product summary data mapping, UI legend/label logic
