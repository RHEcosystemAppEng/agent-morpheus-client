## MODIFIED Requirements
### Requirement: CVE Status donut Chart
The report page SHALL display a donut chart summarizing CVE vulnerability statuses for the current report using backend-provided status counts.

#### Scenario: CVE status donut chart displays
- **WHEN** a user views the report page with product summary data loaded for the selected CVE
- **THEN** the donut chart data SHALL be sourced from `product.summary.cveStatusCounts`
- **AND** status key `TRUE` renders as a red "vulnerable" slice, `FALSE` renders as a green "not_vulnerable" slice, and any other status keys are grouped into a gray "uncertain" slice
- **AND** each slice count equals the corresponding values from `product.summary.cveStatusCounts` (missing keys are treated as zero)
- **AND** the UI SHALL NOT recompute counts from `product.summary.cves`; it SHALL use the backend-provided map as the single source of truth
- **AND** the chart includes a legend showing status labels and counts derived from this map

#### Scenario: CVE status donut chart empty state
- **WHEN** `product.summary.cveStatusCounts` is empty or all counts resolve to zero for the requested CVE
- **THEN** the donut chart displays an empty state message

#### Scenario: CVE status donut chart loading state
- **WHEN** report data is being fetched for the product summary
- **THEN** the donut chart area displays a loading spinner
